# Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Real-Time Project
This project is a data engineering pipeline solution to a made-up business problem, created to aid in my learning and understanding of data pipelining.

## Project Overview

This project addresses a critical business need by building a comprehensive data pipeline on Azure. The goal is to extract customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, transform it in the cloud, and generate actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard will highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender distribution and product category sales, allowing stakeholders to filter and analyze data by date, product category, and gender.

## Business Requirements

The business has identified a gap in understanding customer demographics—specifically gender distribution—and how it influences product purchases. The key requirements include:

1. **Sales by Gender and Product Category**: A dashboard showing the total products sold, total sales revenue, and a gender split among customers.
2. **Data Filtering**: Ability to filter the data by product category, gender, and date.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Stakeholders should have access to an easy-to-use interface for making queries.
